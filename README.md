# System-design-Practice
A repository containing solutions to famous system design problems.


 ##  Designing a cache supporting following operations: [Link](src/main/scala/com/practice/cache)
    - Put: This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache.
    - Get: This will allow user to get a value against a key in the cache.
    - Eviction: If the cache is full, use some eviction policy to free some space.
   
   Expectations:
   
      - Code should be functionally correct
      - Code should be modular and readable.
      - Code should be extensible and scalable
      - Code should follow oops design
